## Academic & Research Context

This automation suite was originally developed as part of a research project at St. Cloud State University, aimed at anonymizing and organizing brain-computer interface (BCI) data for human subjects. The work was submitted for peer review and potential publication in *The International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society* (2024), in collaboration with faculty and researchers across multiple institutions.

The system automates IRB compliance for human subject data by:
- Shuffling and renaming files for anonymity
- Converting BCI recordings to CSV for big data analysis
- Automating recurring privacy tasks with cron scheduling
